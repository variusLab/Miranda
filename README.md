Miranda is a random password generator. A distinctive feature of Miranda compared to classical generators is that it allows you to personalize a set of special characters, as well as insert whole words (i.e. groups of characters). If included, the words can appear in the password randomly or semi-randomly, depending on the strategy chosen by the user.
